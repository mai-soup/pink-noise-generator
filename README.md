# Pink Noise Generator

A simple React app that generates pink noise right in your browser. No looping audio file or anything like that.

## Running

The image is available on DockerHub, so you can run it with:

```bash
docker run -p 5173:5173 -it maisoup/pink-noise-generator  
```

Alternatively, you can build the image yourself, as a Dockerfile is provided.
